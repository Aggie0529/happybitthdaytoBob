# happybitthdaytoBob
Today is World Book Day and also Bob's 22nd birthday. He is a college student and very outstanding, but still feels uncertain about his future and cannot find his direction. This video is made by Aggie to celebrate Bob's birthday, hoping that Bob can be firm and courageous to explore the unknown world.
